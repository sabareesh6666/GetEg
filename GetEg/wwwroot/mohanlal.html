    <h1>Mohanlal</h1>
    <p>Mohanlal Viswanathan, (IPA: [moːhɐnläːl ʋiʃʋɐnɐd̪ɐn]), (born 21 May 1960), known mononymously as Mohanlal, is an Indian actor, film producer, playback singer, television host and film distributor who predominantly works in Malayalam cinema besides also having sporadically appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Hindi-language films.[1][2][3] Mohanlal has a prolific career spanning over four decades, during which he has acted in more than 340 films.[2][4][3] Mohanlal's contributions to the Malayalam cinema have been praised by his contemporaries in the Indian film industry.[5][6][7] The Government of India honoured him with Padma Shri in 2001,[8] and Padma Bhushan in 2019, India's fourth and third highest civilian honours,[9] for his contributions to Indian cinema. In 2009, he became the first actor in India to be awarded the honorary rank of Lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Army.[10][11]</p>
    <p> Mohanlal made his acting debut at age 18 in the Malayalam film Thiranottam in 1978, but the film was delayed in its release for 25 years due to censorship issues. His screen debut was in the 1980 romance film Manjil Virinja Pookkal, in which he played the antagonist.[12][13] He continued to do villainous roles and rose to secondary lead roles in the following years. By the mid-1980s, he established himself as a bankable leading actor and attained stardom after starring in several successful films in 1986; the crime drama Rajavinte Makan released that year heightened his stardom.[12] Mohanlal prefers to work in Malayalam films, but he has also appeared in some Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada films. Some of his best known non-Malayalam films include the Tamil political drama Iruvar (1997), the Hindi crime drama Company (2002) and the Telugu film Janatha Garage (2016).[14][15]</p>
